# Audio_task
You have a folder with audio files and you want to label them as noisy / clean. You need to write a script that will play the mp3 file one by one, after playing each file wait for user input - ‘n’ (for noisy) or ‘c’ (for clean). Once the appropriate key is pressed proceed to the next file. Once all the files are processed export a json file where you have the file names and corresponding labels.
